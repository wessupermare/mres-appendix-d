# D Appendix
> Experiment Reports, Results, and Data

This repository serves as the _D Appendix_ to _An Investigation of SML Using the ART Tool_. Each experiment's report, results, and data can be found in a designated folder. Additionally, the exact version of ART used to generate this data is included in the [ART folder](https://github.com/wessupermare/mres-appendix-d/ART); ART is a rapidly evolving tool which is the subject of its own ongoing research, and thus the decision was made to pin a specific version here to improve the reproducibility of the experiments.
