# D Appendix
> Experiment Reports, Results, and Data

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the _D Appendix_ to _An Investigation of SML Using the ART Tool_. Each experiment's report, results, and data can be found in a designated folder. Additionally, the exact version of ART used to generate this data is included in the [ART folder](https://github.com/wessupermare/mres-appendix-d/tree/master/ART); ART is a rapidly evolving tool which is the subject of its own ongoing research, and thus the decision was made to pin a specific version here to improve the reproducibility of the experiments.  

## Experiments
Experiments 1â€“7 are provided in folders named starting with the experiment number. Experiment four has been omitted as it became a separate project which did not end up being relevant to the rest of the research. These experiments have been numbered chronologically.

## Redistribution
This build of ART is being redistributed through this repository by the written permission of Professor A Johnstone (ART's developer) at Royal Holloway, University of London.  
The materials present in this repository are propery of their respective authors and institutions and:

* Use for purposes beyond the reproduction of the experiments; and 
* Further redistribution

are prohibited without the explicit written permission of the responsible parties.
